>In this section we conducted research on confusion matrix and tried to combine scores in different ways.

We used the Focal system for linear combination of scores and also tried with SVM and DNN fusions.

The figure below shows the confusion analysis for the two systems. As we can see, almost always the prediction of at least one system is correct, so there is a chance to improve the results by fusion.
